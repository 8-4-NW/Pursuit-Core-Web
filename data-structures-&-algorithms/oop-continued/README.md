## Model a Deck of Cards

The goal will be to play a simple game of Blackjack (two players, each get two cards, determine who wins)

**Note**: This is a continuation of yesterday's problem

- Cards with a face of 2 - 10, jack, queen, king ace
- Values of cards 2-10 are same as face, jack, queen, and king are worth 10, ace starts as a value of 11, but can be changed to a value of 1
- There are 4 sets of 13 cards (hearts, diamonds, spades, clubs)

- The card objects should go in an array
- There should be a method that 'shuffles' the deck, the card objects can be reordered
- As each play happens, two cards are given to the player and two are given to the computer player - these cards are removed from the array of card objects

Write down any questions you have about this model, what information is needed? What other considerations are there?

## Bonus

- Make a simple BlackJack game to be played in the console
