# The Flow
Check this out
Hello everyone and welcome to Pursuit! I hope you're as excited as I am for this year. Let's take a minute to talk about some every day questions and flow.

## The Typical Day
* Each morning will begin at 10am with a warm up. You will find the warm up in your classes slack channel.
* After warmup we will have a lecture and then an activity.
* Next will be lunch from 1-2pm sharp.
* Upon return we will have some time to go over questions from the morning exercise.
* Then we will have another lecture, and finally another activity.
* We will end each day at 6pm.

## Where to find the details
Please keep an eye on your Canvas calendar to see what lecture and activities are coming up.

## What do I do about activities?
You will find a link to your activity via Canvas. The link will take you to a Github repository. Before beginning the activity, Fork the repository and then clone the repo onto your machine. Now you have a local copy.

While completing the exercises make sure to commit frequently and to push to your repository. This is how you'll get green squares!

When you have completed the exercise, go to your Github, find the repository, and click on New Pull Request. Create a New Pull Request. Put your name as the pull request message, and if you're pairing put both your names. And... YOU'RE DONE!

## Is there Homework?
Your evening flow should be as following:
* Finish the days activities.
* Compare your solutions with the released solutions.
* Read tomorrows planned lecture.
* We will let you know if there is any additional work outside of this flow.


## What do I do if I get stuck?
* Search for a solution on Google.  
* Ask a peer.
* Seek help from a TA or Instructor.
* Never Give Up!
