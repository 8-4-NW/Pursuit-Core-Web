# Portfolio Project

## Intro

As part of job-readiness, you will be building a personal portfolio site! This site should showcase the work you've been doing at Pursuit, as well as tell potential employers about yourself. 

We find that having a personal site makes a big difference in responses from employers, especially for those trying to get their first jobs. It's also a way to show off your CSS abilities, and the projects you have built in your time here.

Making your portfolio site should be fun - it's going to be an extension of yourself. Make it personal. Get creative! Spend time on making it look good. The details really make a difference. 

## Requirements

The following items are required for your portfolio site to be considered complete.

### Custom domain 

There are lots of sites out there that will sell you a domain name! Here are a couple we suggest:

* hover.com
* name.com
* google domains (https://domains.google/)

Most domains are around $15 a year.

Your domain should be professional-sounding and could even have your name in it! There are tons of TLDs to choose from - .com, .dev, .pizza, .restaurant. Find a creative, interesting combination.

Some bad examples:

* divapixie.party
* tuffguy4.dev
* angelicgrrl.com

Some good examples:

* josecampos.dev
* jacobshaba.zz
* erik-codes.com

When in doubt, ask an instructor or PM! 

> Some two-letter TLDs can only be purchased from specific sites - so hover or google domains may not sell them. So if you come up with a great idea that includes a two-letter domain, you'll have to search for the site that sells it!

[Here's a list of all the available TLDs](./https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains), note that not everything on this list is available for sale.

### 3 pages / sections

You can choose to make your site one long page broken up into sections, or if you're using a framework like gatsby, it's easy to generate multiple routes / pages.

**Homepage**

Your homepage is the first page that appears when the site loads. You know what a homepage is.

**About**

The about page is where you get to talk about yourself. Write a bio. Show a picture. Make this part personal.

**Projects**

This section is where you put the projects you've worked on during your time at Pursuit. Link to each project's github, include a screenshot, and write a description. If the project is deployed, include a link to the live version.

### Responsive Design

Mobile devices make up more than half of all web traffic now. If your site isn't responsive, you're under-serving a whole lot of users. 

Additionally, employers want to see that you can build a site responsively, especially if you're going for a front-end job. Get out those media queries and flex (box)!

Use the developer tools and resize your browser to see how your site looks at various widths.

One suggestion: design your site with mobile in mind first. It's much easier to expand things than it is to squish them.

You can also use a framework, like any of these:

* https://bulma.io/
* https://getbootstrap.com/
* https://get.foundation/

## Linked Projects

Any projects you link to from your portfolio site should have a readme file in the repo.

See [Writing Good Readmes](./WritingGoodReadmes.md) for a good summary of why you should care.

## Personal site inspiration

## Technologies

You can use any technologies you want, but since you're already familiar with React, we suggest using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) or something similar, and deploying your site on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
