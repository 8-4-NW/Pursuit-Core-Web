# Pursuit 6.0 Web Curriculum

## Introduction

Welcome to Pursuit's full-stack web development course. This course is constantly in development - think of it as constantly in beta - but we're proud of it and we hope you enjoy. Take a look at the commit history for updates on our development!

| Unit 4 - [React 1](./react/README.md) | <ul><li>FSW.5.b: Use JSX to create components</li><li>FSW.5.d: Use the state property to build stateful React applications</li><li>FSW.5.e: Use create-react-app to build React applications</li><li>FSW.5.f: Respond to user input to update the views in a React app</li><li>FSW.5.h: Use props to pass data between React components</li><li>FSW.6.a: Use react-router to render components for specific URL extensions</li></ul> |
| Unit 5 - [React 2 (Redux)](./react_2/README.md) | <ul><li>FSW.7.a: Understand the problem of 'prop drilling' in a stateful vanilla React application.</li><li>FSW.7.b: Understand the concept and appeal of a 'single source of truth' and the concept of a centralized, immutable state, updated only via actions.</li>FSW.7.c: Describe and utilize Redux, including action creators, reducers, containers, and stores. Utilize, separate, and recombine reducers to centralize actions and parts of state.<li>FSW.7.d: Describe the appeal of Context and utilize it to create centralized state on small to medium-sized projects.</li><li>FSW.7.e: Know how to discern, based on the scope of a project, whether Redux, Context, or vanilla React is most appropriate.</li></ul> |
