# Working with Strings and Regular Expressions

### Setting intent

> Don't ask yourself whether you _can_ do it. Ask yourself if you want to try. If the answer is yes, just do your best - Karolin

This course is hard. Getting stuck is normal. Getting stuck for hours is normal. Part of programming is learning to cope with feelings of being stuck. During the course, you are in a time of transition in your life. It is easy to let the mind wander into questioning your life decisions, especially when you feel stuck/down.

Most of us don't know what the future holds. Worrying about whether in a year or five you'll be one of the best coders in the world and using that to determine whether you should push through, is going to be much harder on yourself that simply asking "Do I want to be here? Do I want to try to get better?"
