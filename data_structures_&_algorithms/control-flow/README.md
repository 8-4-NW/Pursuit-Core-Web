## Setting Intent

> Comparison is the thief of joy - Teddy Roosevelt 

In an adult learning environment, everyone is coming in with different experience and different levels of knowledge. There is not a way to make a fair comparison. Celebrate what everyone brings and compare yourself to who YOU were yesterday, last week, last month and last year. Acknowledge your own growth and take pride in your work. It doesn't matter if others made it further in a problem set, think about how with more practice, you will become more skilled like they are. 

There will always be a base problem that you should be able to solve (or be really close to solving in the time given). However, to make the most of the time we have for everyone, there are additional problems for those who are ready for it. You can always return to these problems after the course for more practice. 

## Trivia Questions

write an answer commented out to practice talking/writing about code

 - what is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
 - within a function, what is the difference between `return` and `console.log`?

## Print Primes

Write a function that takes an integer and then returns an array of all the prime numbers up to that value.

Be sure to practice your problem solving techniques

## Bonus 

### Triangles

Write a loop that console logs a **right isosceles triangle** made of `#` that has the height and length of the argument.

>Ex: argument is 7
```

Write a loop that console logs an **upside down right isosceles triangle** made of `#` that has the height and length of the argument.

>Ex: argument is 6

Write a loop that console logs and **equilateral triangle** made of `#` (odd arguments only)

>Ex: argument is 5

## Checkerboard

Make a checkerboard of `#` (don't forget to look up what the standard size of a checkerboard is)

The appearance should be like:

```
