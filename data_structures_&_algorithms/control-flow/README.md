## Setting Intent

> Comparison is the thief of joy - Teddy Roosevelt

In an adult learning environment, everyone is coming in with different experience and different levels of knowledge. There is not a way to make a fair comparison. Celebrate what everyone brings and compare yourself to who YOU were yesterday, last week, last month and last year. Acknowledge your own growth and take pride in your work. It doesn't matter if others made it further in a problem set, think about how with more practice, you will become more skilled like they are.

There will always be a base problem that you should be able to solve (or be really close to solving in the time given). However, to make the most of the time we have for everyone, there are additional problems for those who are ready for it. You can always return to these problems after the course for more practice. Just focus on doing your best.

## Trivia Questions

Write an answer somewhere that you can easily use for reference later (make a [mardkdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) file or a word doc, or use the notes app etc. ) to practice talking/writing about code:

- What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
- Within a function, what is the difference between `return` and `console.log`?

## Print Primes

Write a function that takes an integer and then returns an array of all the prime numbers up to that value.

Be sure to practice your problem solving techniques

## More Problems (Solve if you finished the main problem or want more practice)

### FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz is an excellent problem that comes up often because

- it is simple
- it tests your ability to write a function
- it tests your ability to write a loop
- it tests your ability to use if/else statements

It has all the building blocks of a program we talked about that is simple to use

### Triangles

Write a loop that console logs a **right isosceles triangle** made of `#` that has the height and length of the argument.

> Ex: argument is 7

Write a loop that console logs and **equilateral triangle** made of `#` (odd arguments only)

> Ex: argument is 5

Write a loop that console logs and * upside down *equilateral triangle\*\* made of `#` (even arguments only)

> Ex: argument is 8

### Checkerboard

Make a checkerboard of `#` (don't forget to look up what the standard size of a checkerboard is)

The appearance should be like:

```
