# Getting Reassessed on Pursuit Core Standards
To get reassessed, first identify the standards you are not yet proficient in, by looking at your [Gradebook](https://drive.google.com/drive/search?q=gradebook). Non proficient standards are color coded **red** or **yellow** and their scores are 0 and 1 respectively.

Depending on what type of standards you want to get reassessed first pick between **NON-DSA** and **DSA** standards.

## NON-DSA Standards
To get reassessed on non-DSA Standards complete one of the following projects.

* [TV-Watchlist-App-CTA-retake](https://github.com/Pursuit-Core-6-2/TV-Watchlist-App-CTA-retake). Start from scratch building an app that allows users to keep track of the shows they are watching. This project offers a detailed structure you must follow in terms of the back-end enpoints and front-end pages you need and what they should show/do. Give it your own twist and this can be a great portfolio project.

* [Clone App Project](./projects/clone-app-project/README.md). This project is a bit more free form. There is a list of well-known apps you can build clones/replicas of and a set of functionality you must accomplish. You can architect your backend and frontend in whatever way you want but make sure that it is reasonable. If you have questions reach out to your instructors. Add your twist to it for a unique and interesting project you can talk about in interviews and showcase in your portfolio. Getting as close as possible to the original app is also highly valuable.

ðŸ’¡ If you want to get reassessed on standards that are not formally listed in the project's rubric, demonstrate the chosen standard(s) proficiently in your project and bring it up with your instructors. They will be happy to adjust the rubric if you demonstrate you have mastered a specific standard that might not be in the general project rubric.

## DSA Standards
First know that the DSA Standards are divided by DSA Topic:
* DSA-1-b: Linked Lists
* DSA-1-d: Hash Tables
* DSA-1-e: Stacks 
* DSA-1-f: Queues
* DSA-1-g: Trees
* DSA-3: Recursion
* DSA-4: Sorting Algorithms
* DSA-5-b: Binary Search

To get reassessed on DSA Standards:
1. Pick a topic and review its [lesson](https://github.com/joinpursuit/Pursuit-Core-DSA). Also explore the resources linked to in the lesson's Readme.
2. Find and explore other resources online to support your understanding of the topic like YouTube videos or its [CTCI](https://www.google.com/search?gs_ssp=eJzj4tVP1zc0zDIpyDJNKcsxYPTiTC5JzlRIys_PBgBokggk&q=ctci+book&oq=ctci&aqs=chrome.4.69i57j0l3j46j0l3.4069j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) chapter. 
3. Solve the 4-5 problems associated with the specific topic in the [**Standards Reassessments** Table](https://github.com/joinpursuit/Pursuit-Core-DSA#standards-reassessments). These will make sure you understand the given topic and serve as additional practice.
4. Once you have practiced a topic and feel confident you know what it is about reach out to one of your instructors and let them know you would like to schedule a reassessment for a DSA Standard. Your instructor will pick one question at random from **Standards Reassessments** Table and ask it of you in a whiteboarding mock interview. If you demonstrate you understand the topic you will be marked proficient or exceptional in it and your grades will update shortly thereafter.

ðŸ’¡ Reassessing DSA Standards can feel overwhelming, specially if you have to get reassessed in a few of them. Alejo's personal recommendation is to start small. Go for the lowest hanging fruit; pick a topic you think you are most familiar with already or a topic that interests you personally the most, then keep at it for some time reviewing material and practicing on LeetCode or other platforms. Stick with it and you'll see you end up eating it in small bites.

## Misc Standards - Other Projects

* [Responsive Website from mockup](./projects/responsive_site.md). To reassess CSS and HTML related standards only. This can be a good portfolio project to showcase your front-end and css skills.


## Grading
Grading will be done by a member of the instructional team based on the project's associated rubric. Grading might include a 20-40 minute debrief where you get asked questions about your project or asked a whiteboarding question (if reassessing DSA)
