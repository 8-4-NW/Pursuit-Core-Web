and returns an array where the last index of each string is uppercased
- while loop
- build-in method

```

Create a function that takes in an array of numbers, and return only the numbers that are even after 1 is added to their value.

Create a function that takes in an array of numbers, returns all the non-zero numbers in front of all the zeros in the array, then return the new array and the count of non-zero numbers.

```js
input => [2,0,3,0,5,0,7,1,0]
output => [2,3,5,7,1,0,0,0,0,], 4
```

Create a function that takes in array of integer, find the two numbers that when multiplied together give the greatest product, and return that product.

```js
input => [2,7,5,8,3,9,1]
output => 72
```

Create a function that returns the number of argument it was called with.

```js
input => howManyArgs()
output => 0
input => howManyArgs(1,3,5)
output => 3
input => howManyArgs(false,'maybe','perhaps', 'nah bruh',true)
output => 5
```
