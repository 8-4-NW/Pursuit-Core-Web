# reCAPTCHA: Protect your sites against bots and abuse

Today we will learn how to add a simple [reCAPTCHA](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha) checkbox as a defense strategy to mitigate bots that might want to spam or overload our app and tell them apart from human users. 

We will use [reCAPTCHA v2](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/display) for the purposes of this lesson but there are is a [new version v3](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/v3) that doesn't require a checkbox at all that you might want to learn about later.

## Intro
reCAPTCHA is a free service that protects your site from spam and abuse. It uses advanced risk analysis techniques to tell humans and bots apart. 

How does this work? Well, we will import some scripts and a checkbox widget that Google provides us and add them to our React App, in turn the reCAPTCHA checkbox/widget will be placed in the DOM. This reCAPTCHA uses Google's algorithms that monitor our page to tell apart actions that might come from real users or bots, for example if clicks are happening too fast or the user doesn't pass over other elements as they are moving their mouse it is likely a bot and it should be prevented to proceed further. If Google is not sure if your user is a bot just by their interactions with the page, it will present a reCAPTCHA challenge where the user will get asked to select images that match a certain description. Like "Select all images that contain Bicycles". Upon the user checking the checkbox or completing the challenge we are certain that the user is a human and we can let them keep interacting with our page.

### Screenshots

## Use Cases
When do you want to verify that who is interacting with your site is a human? In general whenever you wanna make sure the information you are receiving is coming from a person and not a bot. Or whenever you don't want some automated script that can run super fast thousands of times to perform a certain on your site.

Some examples are:
* When a someone is signing up or logging in for your app
* When someone is checking out an order in your site
* When someone is booking plane tickets
* Most of the times in some sort of form

## Flow
The reCAPTCHA verification flow goes something like this:

## Steps

### 1. Clone [Starter Full-Stack App](https://github.com/joinpursuit/recaptcha-fullstack-example) [Optional]

### 2. Register site for reCAPTCHA

To use reCAPTCHA we first need to register a new site with Google's reCAPTCHA service.

Go to the [reCAPTCHA console](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create) and be sure to be logged in with your Pursuit Gmail Account. Any Google Account will do really.

Fill out the registration form as follows:
* **reCAPTCHA type** ‚Üí reCAPTCHA v2 ‚Üí "I'm not a robot" Checkbox"
* **Domains** ‚Üí Add the domain where you have your app deployed for example `my-fullstack.herokuapp.com` and `localhost`
* **Accept the reCAPTCHA Terms of Service** ‚Üí checked
* **Send alerts to owners** ‚Üí checked
* Hit Submit

</details>

Once you submit the form you will be given two keys:
* **site key**: Is public facing and used in the front-end for the reCAPTCHA widget. 
* **secret key**: Is secret and will be used in the backend to verify the reCAPTCHA token an environment variable.

Copy you keys somewhere, we will use them in a bit.

**Notes**:

* ‚ö†Ô∏è Once you have fully integrated reCAPTCHA and deployed remember to remove `localhost` from your domains settings, otherwise an bad user running on localhost will be able to abuse your site.


### 3. Install and set up `react-google-recaptcha` in the front-end

The package we will use to integrate reCAPTCHA in our react apps is [`react-google-recaptcha` üìò](https://github.com/dozoisch/react-google-recaptcha). 

Install it in your frontend with: 

```
npm install --save react-google-recaptcha
```

### 4. Frontend setup

Think about what is the action in your app a user can do that you want to protect from bots, in our case that will be the login and sign up forms for our site. Then it is in those components that we will use reCAPTCHA.

Import the `ReCAPTCHA` component from `react-google-recaptcha` in the component you want to protect, in our case that is `AuthContainer.jsx` which renders both the signup and login form.

```jsx
import ReCAPTCHA from 'react-google-recaptcha'
```

Add `notBot` and `recaptchaToken` properties to your state so that we know when the bot challenge has been passed and for us to hold onto the verification token.

```jsx
// ...skipped code

 state = {
    username: '',
    password: '',
    notBot: false,
    recaptchaToken: ''
  }

```

Render the `ReCAPTCHA` component passing the `sitekey`, `onChange`, `onErrored` props.

```jsx
// ...skipped code
  handleCaptcha = (token) => {
    if (token) {
      this.setState({
        notBot: true,
        recaptchaToken: token
      })
    } else {
      // reCAPTCHA verification expired
      this.setState({
        notBot: false,
        recaptchaToken: '',
      })
      window.alert('Human verification expired, please indicate you are not a robot again.')
    }
  }

  handleCaptchaError = (err) => {
    this.setState({
      notBot: false,
      recaptchaToken: '',
    })

    window.alert('There was an error. Please check your network and try again later.')
  }

  render() {
    const { isUserLoggedIn } = this.props;
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>AuthContainer</h2>
        {
          isUserLoggedIn
            ? <Redirect to="/profile" />
            : (
              <Switch>
                <Route path="/login" render={this.renderLoginForm} />
                <Route path="/signup" render={this.renderSignupForm} />
              </Switch>
            )
        }
        <ReCAPTCHA
          sitekey="YOUR_SITE_KEY"
          onChange={this.handleCaptcha}
          onErrored={this.handleCaptchaError}
        />
      </div>
    )
  }
```
You can just replicate this for any action someone can make in your app, for which you want an extra check to make sure your that someone is a human and not a bot. 

At a high level the steps were
* Display the reCAPTCHA checkbox widget with the `ReCAPTCHA` component
* Handle when the user indicates that they are not a bot with the `onChange` prop.
  * Save the verification token provided by the reCAPTCHA widget to the state
* Handle when there's an error with the `onErrored` prop
* When submitting your form/performing the action, check that the user verified they were not a bot and send the `recaptchaToken` with your request to the backend.
