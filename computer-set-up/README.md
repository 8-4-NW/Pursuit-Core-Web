# Pursuit Core Environment Setup

Welcome to Pursuit! We can't wait to begin this journey with you. Before we dive right in and begin programming it is important that we first get our machines up to date and setup. Please follow the instructions below so we can all start with the same setup.

We will be installing programs that we need about 4 times throughout the duration of the program. We will only be installing what we need for the upcoming work we will be doing.

Times we will do some installations:

- At the very beginning of the course.
- Mid-way through Module 1
- During later modules
