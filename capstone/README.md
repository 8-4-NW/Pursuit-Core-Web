# Pursuit Core Capstone Project

Your capstone project is a creative, polished, 10+ weeks long group project where you get to build a Full-Stack Web Application from the ground up. For the vast majority of Pursuit alumni, their capstone project has represented the single most important, technically complete and impressive project they have ever built. 

Professionally Capstone is a well rounded experience, you will get to work with volunteers who are professional developers, in fact they will be your mentors. Capstone will teach you not only how to work in a group setting but also, project management, how to prioritize tasks, how address and resolve conflict as well as sharpen your communication skills. You wanna keep these lessons in mind because you will most likely get asked about them in behavioral interviews at tech companies.

All of this makes your Capstone project an great asset on your portfolio, resume and LinkedIn profile.

## Objectives
#### Technical Mastery
You will create a polished, technically impressive project.

#### Professional Skills
You will get more comfortable in a team setting and with workplace skills. You’ll hone your narrative and presentation skills in front of audience - both self- and product-narrative.

## Capstone Phases
Roughly capstone has four phases. The timelines for these phases will look different for each individual class.

1. Ideation
2. Wireframing & App Proposal.
3. Prototype
4. MVP → Technical Showcase
5. Polished MVP & Deployment → Demo Day

#### Technical Showcase
Technical showcase comes after **MVP** and is an event where tech and architecture is the focus. Engineers from top tech companies get invited to see your projects and give you technical feedback to improve apps. All groups participate in this event.

#### Demo Day
Demo Day comes after **Polished MVP & Deployment**. The focus of the event is presentation and demoing of your app from a user perspective, with a focus on market and product feedback.
Attended by top executives, investors and professionals from the tech sector as well as family and friends. Will include all qualifying groups.
